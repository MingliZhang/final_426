# COMP 426 final project

## Welcome to our Miao Miao web app.

List of funcitons that our web app has:

### Group Chat Function

 This group chat function allows the user to chat with all other loged in users without the fear that your chat history will be secretly shared. The chat happens in real time without any time delay (unless your wifi is poor), and is not going to be stored in any shape of form. Once you exit the window, all history will be cleared! Who needs Snapchat to delete your history 24 hours latter?

### post functions

Have you ever had a question that you want to ask a friend of yours but does not dare to ask? Then we got you covered! Miao Miao also provides the function for users to post anonymous questions to your friends. So be bold and have fun!

### Personality test

It is hard for people to step outside of their commfort zone and make new friends. We experience that too. However, Miao Miao is here to the help. Miao Miao has a personality test for all users to compelet once you signed up (you can skip it, but this feature will not be avaliable to you untile you do the test) and will suggest other users based on how simillar your personalities are. 

However, we do not want you to feel distanced from you existing friends, you can follow who you already know in real life just by searching their username.

### bad word detection

Although our app has anonymous features, this does not mean this web app is a place for people to spread hatred language. All posts, questions, and usernames cannot contain any inappropriate words. If contained, they will be replaced by "\*". To achieve this, we used a their party api for bad word detections. Basically, we will send the content we want it to check and it will return back the content without the bad words being blocked out. 
Be aware, this does not mean
