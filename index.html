            <p>Welcome to our Miao Miao web app. Like most social apps, Miao Miao provides chat functions, post functions, add friends functions, and suggest friends functions. The whole app is created so that everyone can use it easily. We promise you that the learning curve is almost non-existent and you will be connected to others in a blink of an eye.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Miao Miao is unique in a way that it contains a personality test and will recommend people who have similar test results to you. However, we do not limit you to those who are like you. You can also add friends who you already know in real life. All you need is to know their username! What's more, Miao Miao also provides you the opportunity to post anonymous questions/posts to your friends. Be bold and ask them things you would not dare to ask in person!</p>
            </br>
              <p>The chat function is also unique. We built something like Snapchat. However, unlike Snapchat that claims to delete your chat history 24 hours after you post them, we do not store the chat history at all! once the webpage is closed, the chat history is gone forever, even our developers cannot get it back!!</p>
            </br>
              <p>Be aware, this does not mean this web app is a place where you spread hatred language. All posts, questions, and usernames cannot contain any inappropriate words. If contained, they will be replaced by "*". </p>
